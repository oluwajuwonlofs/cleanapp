    <h1 class="header" style="text-align:center;">About <em style="color:rgb(0, 153, 255);">CleanApp</em></h1>
    <p>
      <em style="color: rgb(0, 153, 255);">CleanApp</em> is a web/mobile application that affords people with dirty laundry
      the opportunity to have their dirty laundry picked up, cleaned and delivered 
     crisp from the comfort of thier homes or anywhere they find themselves in the 
     Lagos Metropolis; Delivery could take 1-5 days depending on specifications 
     <a href="">(see terms and condition).</a>
     The <em style="color:rgb(0, 153, 255)">CleanApp</em>
     is not limited to serving only users who wish to 
     <em style="color: rgb(0, 153, 255);">clean</em> 
     dirty laundry But also serves; Dispatchers and Drycleaners.</p>
        
    <p>Dispatchers can therefore earn miniful pay on the <em style="color: rgb(0, 153, 255);">CleanApp</em>
        by virtue of signing up on the CleanApp. It is important to emphasis that
        dispatchers must take necessary integrity test in a bid to gather concrete informations
        of the dispatchers which is solely confidential to The cleanapp  to ensure maxmum satisfaction
        and protection of 'Users' and their high-end laundry. <em style="color: rgb(0, 153, 255);">CleanApp</em>.
        'Dispatchers' who pass the integrity test/check would be allowed or assigned to pick up dirty laundry and deliver
        back clean and crisp to 'Users' from the 'Drycleaners".  <a href="">(see....Select Categories)</a>
     </p>
        
        <p>
          Drycleaners i.e businesses like laundromarts and drycleaning services center(s)
          can harness the <em style="color:rgb(0, 153, 255)">CleanApp</em> for profit 
          and to increase sales by leveraging 'Users" of CleanApp
          as its customers' for their laundromarts or drycleaning business. 
          It is important to retraite clearly that Drycleaners by way of leveraging 'Users'
          of CleanAPP do not in anyway have direct contact with the 'User' whose laundry 
          was dispatched by the 'Dispatcher'. <a href="">( see... Select Categories)</a>
        </p>
            
        <p>
          The <em style="color:rgb(0, 153, 255);">CleanApp</em> is infused with a pay-on-request
          payment system, such that eliminates not only situations where 'Users' don't pay for service;
          It also helps to avert unneccesarry arguments or confrontations  between 'Dispatcher(s)' and 'User(s)' over pay. 
          In addition, the payment system being infused in <em>CleanApp</em>, also evicts the bottleneck that Drycleaners face
          in that they no longer have to have a stock-pile of different clothings from different customers without pay 
          for a long period of time,
